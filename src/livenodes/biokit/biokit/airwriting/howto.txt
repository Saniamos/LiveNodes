Howto use the Airwriting experimentation system

We just use biokit for every script even if it does not depend on it for 
convenience reasons.

The database uri must be compatible with sqlalchemy, e.g.

"mysql+mysqldb://@i19pc56/diss"

for the mysql server on i19pc56 with anonymous login using the database diss.

1. Get an empty database and prepare it 
	
	For example use 

    /home/camma/dumps/diss_with_recordings_and_sets.sql

    load it into an existing mysql database via

    mysql dbname < /home/camma/dumps/diss_with_recordings_and_sets.sql
	
2. Generate jobs for character training

	biokit confgen_trainchar.py <dburi>
	
	All parameters must be specified within the confgen file in source
	
3. Run the Scheduler and let it do the job 

	if biokit is installed nicely you do not have to give absolute paths
	to the executable
	<rundir> is the directory where it really runs all the jobs, must be 
		accesible from all machines, a subdirectory is created for every job
	<logdir> is the directory where the scheduler saves the job log
	-k means keep the files, should generally not be necessary
	<machines> machines to use, format is "2 3 6 8" (i19pc2, i19pc3, ...)

    python scheduler.py <dburi> "biokit <path-to-pythonlib>/runrecognizer.py --dir <rundir> -k" <logdir> <machines>
    
4. Generate jobs for word training 
	
	biokit confgen_trainword.py <dburi>
	
	All parameters must be specified in the source file, basemodels with 
	correct configuration must exist
	
5. Run Scheduler again

6. Generate jobs for sentence cross-validation

	biokit confgen_sentence.py <dburi>
	
	Parameters must be specified in source file
	
7. Run Scheduler again

*** Known bugs ***

1. Handling of basemodel search is incomplete for word and sentence configs
