## Config notes (see image)

The device (most likely pi or computer), that wants to receive signals hast to have the ip set in the riot configuration.
Currently 192.168.1.101

The sample rate setting is weird.
A high value, eg 150 gives a low sample rate, ie smth like 7hz
while a low value eg 5 or 2, both give exactly 100Hz

I guess don't change anymore...
